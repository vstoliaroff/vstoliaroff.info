> Hey there! My name is Vincent Stoliaroff. I am a born-again data scientist with a  background in economics and statistics. I have started this blog to structure a few  thoughts I had on several topics of interest to me: `R` programming, computer and data  science (at large!).

### Home

Here I am blogging about thematized issues where the focus is a specific question to answer or a difficulty to overcome. 

I try to stick to the following outline which could be thought of as my *post manifesto* or *post sequence scenario*.

* One Problem: A good post should start with a problem to solve rather than abstract development about tools and methodologies.  The story is the emphasis more than data, models and coding subtleties. 
* A data science based attempt at solution.
Here come the data science tools in play. Statistical facts and methods should help us tackle the issue at stake.  
* Credits: 
Trigger for posting and what brought me on track for solutions are mostly related to readings, job assignments I receive or news feeds. I refer them in this section.  
* Factory: 
Reproducibility of post and analysis should be ensured with links to my [Github](https://github.com/vincesto) or other repositories. 


### Logbuch 
My *vademecum* of code snippets. I throw there any piece of program that I may have used once and could reapply in other circumstances. I use it as a quick index for code refactoring techniques and  
To keep it light, I link most of the entries to Gist or other code repos.
