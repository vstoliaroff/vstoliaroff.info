## Question of the day

I do not know what is the authoring framework mostly used by musicologists, but I would bet that [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html) has a very low audience share in this community. And that is a pity! For websites, reports, presentation or books the R markdown *suite* is a very good option to consider as soon as you adhere to the [litterate programming paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming). You may ask why musicologist would care? Enter Lilypond!

_(You probably didn't hear it, but the above abstract was a snare-drum roll followed by a crash cymbal explosion! So literally: "Ta-da!")_

Quoting [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LilyPond), [Lilypond](http://lilypond.org/) is a text-based application for music engraving and can output music notation to PDF (via PostScript) or other graphical formats, such as SVG or PNG. The workflow for typesetting music notation with LilyPond is similar to that of preparing documents with LaTeX.

Because it can be called from the pure command line, we can execute it from within R Markdown documents through *Bash chunk* without too much difficulties. In this post, I'll try to show how. 


## The solution
### Embed your music quote 

For the demonstration we will use the very simple of C Major Arpeggio:

</div>




First of all, lilypond must be set up on your machine. On Debian, the following command does the job of installing the latest version


```bash
sudo apt-get install lilypond 
```

Every lilypond script can be compiled in a shell with the following command: 



```bash
lilypond my_lilypond_script.ly
```

So, we will use the `cat` engine option in R chunk to create our script. I do not comment in details the lilypond syntax itself. Please note that the paper options are there to prevent white spaces around the staff.


```r
```{r, engine='cat', engine.opts=list(file='cM-arpeggio.ly')} 
\version "2.18.2"
\paper{
  indent=0\mm
  line-width=120\mm
  oddFooterMarkup=##f
  oddHeaderMarkup=##f
  bookTitleMarkup=##f
  scoreTitleMarkup=##f
}
{
  \clef treble
  c'4 e' g' c''
}

```
```

Once the file has been created, we need to compile it which we will do with a bash chunk: 

```r
```{bash, echo=FALSE}
mkdir ./temp-lilypond
cd temp-lilypond
lilypond -dbackend=eps -dno-gs-load-fonts -dinclude-eps-fonts -dpixmap-format=pngalpha --png ../cM-arpeggio.ly &>all.log
cp cM-arpeggio.png ../../images/cM-arpeggio.png # copy the image in jekyll images directory 
cd ..
rm -r temp-lilypond
rm cM-arpeggio.ly
```
```
Note the compilation options to get a png image output. Because my blog is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), I stick to the recommended [directory structure](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/) and save my image in a separate `images` folder. Hence the somehow tedious scripting to copy and remove the image file... 

You can use a lilypond IDE to control the output of your script beforehand. I have tested [Frescobaldi](http://frescobaldi.org/) which I found relatively user-friendly. 

The last step is to include the image in your document with the standard 


```r
![Picture Caption](/path/to/cM-arpeggio.png)
```

For jekyll user, the `site.url` variable defined in your _config.yml file can be used for facilitating the deployment of your website when specifying the path. Check [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#including-images-and-resources) for details. 


### Advanced Lilypond: the circle of fifths

Just for the fun of it, we will render a lilypond snippet found in [this repository](https://lsr.di.unimi.it/) to give a taste of lilypond advanced features. It represents the [cycle of fifths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_fifths)
The complete code is to be found [here](https://lsr.di.unimi.it/form.php?type=snippet;id=1040;rld=m_snippet).

## Wait for the next `knit_engines` pull request!

The lilypond compiling call and the subsequent shifting and deletion of output files in the shell could likely be simplified. As suggested by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name/knitr/demo/engines/), extending `knitr` with other chunk engines is [an ongoing process](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/blob/master/R/engine.R). There could be a more straightforward solution as the one I have suggested. Ideally it should be as simple as calling a R chunk and plotting a graph. Let's wait for the soon-to-come lilypond dedicated chunk pull request!
